You will be required to attend sessions at our UA92 Business School in Salford, every weekday evening from 5:30pm-7pm .\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT COMES NEXT? \n\n\n\nThis could be the start of your journey to higher education. Throughout the programme, we will advise you on which pathways might be available for you, and any associated entry requirements.\nWe will support you throughout the entire process, and we’ll also be here to help guide your next steps into an exciting future.\n\n\n\n\n\nIS FAST FORWARD LIKE THE ACCESS TO HE COURSE?\n\n\n\nAn Access to Higher Education course is a level 3 qualification that can typically be completed in 1 year and is widely recognised by UK Universities. However, depending on your previous experience and/or educational qualifications you may be eligible to apply for a UA92 course without completing an Access to HE course. Fast Forward is a 1 week short course that aims to help prepare you for Higher Education and support you on to the correct pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERESTED IN JOINING THE FAST FORWARD PROGRAMME?\nREGISTER YOUR INTEREST\n\n\n\n\nREGISTER YOUR INTEREST\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPhone Number\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nDOB*\n\t\n\n\n\n\nWhy are you interested in Fast Forward?*\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Academy 92 (UA92) will hold and use the information you supply in line with our privacy policy.

Uni Sceptic. UA92 Student.\nThe Fast Forward course was Kelsey’s ticket back to education. She’s now working towards her dream career by studying Sports Coaching at UA92. \n“After leaving college, I started coaching sports, a job I absolutely loved! I did some coaching qualifications but realised that if I wanted to progress as a coach, I needed to look at higher education. I knew it wasn’t straight forward as I didn’t have traditional qualifications and I had been out of education for a while. Someone recommended the Fast Forward course at UA92 so I took a leap of faith and signed myself up. After a week on the course I knew I wanted to come here and after initially doing a Cert HE, I’m now in the second year of my degree.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATT RICHARDS, COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT\nMatt completed the Fast Forward course in 2021 and is now in the third year of a Computer Science degree at UA92.\n“I was self-employed for 10 years and reached a point where I wanted to do something different. I phoned a number of universities but when I spoke to the Admissions team at UA92, I felt like they were genuinely trying to help me get where I wanted to be.\n“Without the Fast Forward course, I wouldn’t have known where to start. I didn’t have traditional A-levels so it helped me understand the best way for me to get onto a degree course. Everything was explained and it finally made sense. The staff are amazing – they are so invested in you achieving your goals. When I got an unconditional offer on a Digital course, everyone was celebrating.”\n\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\nREGISTER FOR FAST FORWARD\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Content Production Cert HE\nDigital Content Production BA (Hons)\nBusiness of Football Cert HE\nBusiness of Football BSc (Hons)\nAccounting   Cert HE\nSoftware Development Cert HE\nSports Journalism Cert HE\nDigital Marketing Cert HE\nSports and Exercise Science Cert HE\nSports Media and Communications Cert HE\nSports Management Cert HE\nPhysical Education Cert HE\nSports Coaching Cert HE\nExercise Studies Cert HE\nBusiness Management Cert HE\nAccounting and Business Management Accelerated BSc (Hons)\nCyber Security   Cert HE\nDigital Marketing Accelerated BA (Hons)\nSports Media and Communications Accelerated BA (Hons)\nSports Management Accelerated BA (Hons)\nSports Journalism Accelerated BA (Hons)\nSports Coaching Accelerated BSc (Hons)\nSports and Exercise Science Accelerated BSc (Hons)\nPhysical Education Accelerated BA (Hons)\nHealth, Exercise and Sport Accelerated BSc (Hons)\nCyber Security Accelerated BSc (Hons)\nAccounting and Business Management  Cert HE\nComputer Science Accelerated BSc (Hons)\nBusiness Management Accelerated BSc (Hons)\nAccounting and Finance Accelerated BA (Hons)\nHealth, Exercise and Sport BSc (Hons)\nSports Coaching BSc (Hons)\nSports and Exercise Science BSc (Hons)\nPhysical Education BA (Hons)\nSports Journalism BA (Hons)\nSports Media and Communications BA (Hons)\nCyber Security BSc (Hons)\nComputer Science BSc (Hons)\nAccounting and Business Management BSc (Hons)\nBusiness Management BSc (Hons)\nSports Management BA (Hons)\nAccounting and Finance BA (Hons)\nDigital Marketing BA (Hons)\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPhone Number\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nDOB*\n\t\n\n\n\n\nWhy are you interested in Fast Forward?*\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Academy 92 (UA92) will hold and use the information you supply in line with our privacy policy.

Starting a new career was a daunting prospect. I saw an advert on social media for the Skills for Life Bootcamp and applied. I didn’t have a tech background so I was a bit nervous. Now I can launch an EC2 virtual machine in a specific region around the globe. I have also developed coding skills and knowledge of computer languages including Python.”\nRead Neil's Story\n\n\n\n\n\nKEVIN WONG\nCLOUD ENGINEERING\n“I am a qualified schoolteacher.

I was instantly curious and contacted them to find out more. It wasn’t like any of the traditional universities I’d visited, and I liked that, but I would still get the prestigious degree from Lancaster University which was a bonus! The Lancaster connection was a big draw.” – Alex Keir, UA92 Student\n“UA92 offers a different approach to higher education and is a real alternative for people who otherwise may not have chosen to go to university. It’s an excellent choice for those students looking for different ways to learn and increase their life skills, personal networks, and employment prospects.” – Professor Andy Schofield, Vice-Chancellor at Lancaster University.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROSPECTUS\n\n\n\nCHARACTER & PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n\nPARENTS & GUARDIANS\n\n\n\n\nSPEAK TO US\nWE’RE HERE\nTO CHAT\n\nGOT A QUESTION?

The campus wasn’t too big as to be overwhelming and the quality of the student accommodation was a huge bonus. The staff were knowledgeable, honest and open to answering any questions. So, I was absolutely delighted when Elliott chose UA92. Even though he had other offers from places closer to home, it just felt ‘right.’\nJason | Parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Cross Street\nOne Cross Street is a collection of fully-furnished modern apartments, located close to Manchester city-centre, just 0.3 miles (7-minute walk) from our UA92 Business School.\nAll contracts for One Cross Street are 51 weeks in length.\nThe building has an abundance of heritage features, including exposed brickwork, original beams, and large windows.\nApartments are fitted with luxury appliances and all utilities are included.

The event brings together key politicians, business leaders, media and thought provoking influencers from Greater Manchester area and beyond.\nLauren White from National World, said “This has been running for 4 years and in 2022 we held it for the first time in Manchester.\nMy experience with UA92 has been great. From the start Deena was on hand to help me envisage the event taking place here. I am based in Scotland, so Deena was very accommodating in showing me the space in person as well as via video call. The event space was a different concept to what we have done before but with the imagination of the UA92′ team we were able to utilise the full facility and bring our vision to life. All of the staff I dealt with on the day of the event as well as in advance were very professional, quick at replying and more than happy to look into any requests we had.\nOverall, I would highly recommend UA92 to anyone who is looking for a unique venue with a dedicated team to guide you through it all . I appreciate the dedication of the events team as well as the institution’s commitment to providing a smooth running and exceptional event.”\nENQUIRE NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\n \n\nGET IN TOUCH\nE: [email protected]\nT: +44 (0)161 507 1992\n\n\nFIND US\nWe have two locations in Manchester:\n\n\nOld Trafford Campus\n\n\nUA92 Business School\n\n\n\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nOpen Days & Events\nMake It For Real\nKey Academic Dates\nStudent Support & Well-being\nThe Class of 92\nCorporate Information\nWork At UA92\nContact Us\nFind Us\n \n\n\n\n\nGET IN TOUCH\nUA92 works with exceptional individuals, organisations and businesses with the aim of fast-tracking our students’ careers and providing top talent to drive tomorrow’s business successes.\nIf you have a question or would like to work with us in the future, please do contact us:\nE: [email protected]\nT: +44 (0)161 507 1992\n\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nOpen Days & Events\nMake It For Real\nKey Academic Dates\nStudent Support & Well-being\nThe Class of 92\nCorporate Information\nWork At UA92\nContact Us\nFind Us\n \n\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\n FIND US\nWe have two locations in Manchester:\n\n\nOld Trafford Campus\n\n\nUA92 Business School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\n\nUniversity Academy 92 is a registered higher education provider with the Office for Students.\n© 2025 University Academy 92.

Our curriculum is co-developed with industry and our partners, and students gain a respected qualification in the form of a degree awarded by academic pioneers Lancaster University.\nAlong the way, students will take a personal journey of development, discover new capabilities and confidence, and develop their emotional, social, physical, and cognitive intelligence. All this combines to help your bright spark become tomorrow’s success story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFINDING THE RIGHT COURSE\nChoosing the right course can be a difficult decision for some students.\nOur courses focus in four key subject areas: Sport, Business, Media and Digital. We also offer many different levels of study, so encourage you to explore our course options below. Find out everything you need to know from modules studied to the course content and how it’s taught.\nMORE\n\n\n\n\nACCOMMODATION\nThis may be the first time your child has lived away from home, and we understand how much of a big deal that really is.\nVIEW\n\n\nRest assured, our student accommodation is safe, secure, and just a stone’s throw away from our campus. Both options on offer to UA92 students offer stylish and modern, self-contained studio apartments which come fully furnished including a double bed, study area, en-suite, and kitchen; none of which is shared with other students.\n“The accommodation at UA92 is top end. Think more ‘young professional’ than ‘student digs’. With all mod cons in apartments as standard, it’s one less thing to worry about as a parent.” – Jason Pettigrove UA92 Parent\n\n\n\n\nTHEIR APPLICATION\nStudents can apply to join UA92 either through UCAS or directly to us.\n \nAPPLY\n\n\nApplying to higher education can be daunting and whilst your child’s school or college should support them with their application, we encourage you to do so too by keeping up to date with Key Dates and UCAS deadlines.\nThe support doesn’t just stop there though, as our Student Recruitment team are more than happy to help with any questions either you or your child should have related to their application. Email [email protected].\nFor more information on how the application process works or to help your child begin their application, click the button below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFINANCE\nSUPPORT\nVISIT US\n\n\n\nWe understand that student finance, and particularly your child managing their own finances, can be a scary thought. Our student teams are always on hand to help your child should they be struggling or need some advice.\nWe also offer multiple different support packages , to help your child access higher education without any financial barriers.\nFrom student loans to maintenance loans and how to apply, you can find all the information you need on our Fees and Finance Page.\nVIEW\n\n\nWe take pride in our well-being services for our students, and the support we offer them throughout their time studying with us.\nShould your child have a condition that could affect their ability to study, this should be disclosed on either their UCAS application, or self-referred to our Inclusive Support Service as soon as possible by emailing [email protected].\nOur aim is to remove barriers and provide an inclusive environment to all students, with support, counselling, and other services available to them should it be required.\n“I really feel like UA92 is one big support bubble. There are regular sessions every week. One of my favourite sessions is Tea & Talk on a Wednesday afternoon. It’s really relaxed and informal and you feel comfortable talking to people.” – Abz, UA92 Student.\nVIEW\n\n\nDon’t just take our word for it – come and visit us yourself to see what life at UA92 is really like for your child.\nOur Open Days are the perfect opportunity for you to experience UA92 first-hand.

The ratings reflect the extent to which a provider delivers an excellent experience and outcomes for its mix of undergraduate students and across the range of its undergraduate courses and subjects. 228 providers took part in the TEF 2023.\nGary Pritchard, Chief Academic Officer at UA92, said;\n“Achieving an Overall Rating of Silver in our first TEF review is a huge achievement. It is unheard of from a higher education institution of our age to receive this accolade so quickly and these results are testament to the expertise of our team – from our professors right through to our administration and wellbeing staff.\n“We hope that these results will show students who are considering UA92 as their chosen higher education establishment that we will provide them with excellence across both their academic journey and their overall university experience.”\nThe TEF results follow previous successes for the establishment, having ranked above the UK average in teaching, learning opportunities, feedback and assessment and academic support, in the 2023 National Student Survey.*\nUA92 currently has over 1,000 students enrolled in degree and higher education courses across business, sport, media and digital disciplines at its Old Trafford campus, and its brand new Business School campus, which opened this September in Manchester city centre.\nLobbying to make higher education accessible to all through its founding principles of accessibility, social mobility and inclusivity, more than 21% of UA92 students are from the most disadvantaged areas of the community (national average of 13.5% – UCAS). It has targets to have more students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds than the most advantaged.\n*Find out more about what our NSS Results say.\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN OTHER NEWS\nVIEW ALL\n\n\n\n\n\n17/03/25\nUA92 joins forces with a champion of women’s health –  Emma Neville \nBlogs \n\n\n\n\n31/01/25\nUA92 Partners with Swinton Lions\nBlogsNews & Announcements \n\n\n\n\n31/01/25\nUA92 is Breaking Down Barriers in the Community\nBlogs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\n \n\nGET IN TOUCH\nE: [email protected]\nT: +44 (0)161 507 1992\n\n\nFIND US\nWe have two locations in Manchester:\n\n\nOld Trafford Campus\n\n\nUA92 Business School\n\n\n\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nOpen Days & Events\nMake It For Real\nKey Academic Dates\nStudent Support & Well-being\nThe Class of 92\nCorporate Information\nWork At UA92\nContact Us\nFind Us\n \n\n\n\n\nGET IN TOUCH\nUA92 works with exceptional individuals, organisations and businesses with the aim of fast-tracking our students’ careers and providing top talent to drive tomorrow’s business successes.\nIf you have a question or would like to work with us in the future, please do contact us:\nE: [email protected]\nT: +44 (0)161 507 1992\n\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nOpen Days & Events\nMake It For Real\nKey Academic Dates\nStudent Support & Well-being\nThe Class of 92\nCorporate Information\nWork At UA92\nContact Us\nFind Us\n \n\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\n FIND US\nWe have two locations in Manchester:\n\n\nOld Trafford Campus\n\n\nUA92 Business School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\n\nUniversity Academy 92 is a registered higher education provider with the Office for Students.\n© 2025 University Academy 92.

It’s given by the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), a national scheme that assesses undergraduate courses in the UK. \n\n\n\n\nASK OUR DIGITAL STUDENTS\nOur friendly ambassadors are ready to answer your questions. Click on the ‘Ask me a question’ button to start a conversation.\n\n\n\n\n*The NSS results referred to above compares UA92’s results against the 4 Universities in Greater Manchester (University of Bolton, Manchester Metropolitan University, Salford University and The University of Manchester). Teaching, Assessment and Feedback and Academic support refers to the average score across all questions in these themes. Mental health support services refers to question: How well communicated was information about your university/college’s mental wellbeing support services?\n**There may be exams in some subject areas, but we avoid this where possible. Any exams will be undertaken at the end of the module instead of at the end of the academic year.\n*** If you start in February, April or June or as an accelerated student, we can’t guarantee your timetable will be fixed am/pm throughout your studies.\n\n\n\n\nENTRY REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n\nThe standard entry requirements for the BSc (Hons) Computer Science course is 104 UCAS points.* However, each application is assessed on an individual basis, taking into consideration a wide range of factors.

At DigitalMe, I developed UK-wide youth digital skills projects – including Supporter To Reporter, which took Trafford teenagers to the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nI founded Hive Manchester, an award-winning social enterprise helping young people learn digital skills in fun and creative ways. Hive reached over 4000 young people and 220 schools, colleges and universities, especially in disadvantaged areas of Greater Manchester.\n\nI have worked closely with top tech employers like Cisco, Mozilla and Accenture, developing some of the UK’s first Digital Apprenticeships and a Princes Trust-supported digital bootcamp. I am a STEM ambassador, Code Club Founder, Coderdojo Champion and Raspberry Pi Certified Educator. Away from the screens I love to run, swim and cycle in the hills of my hometown Buxton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMehak Memon\nLecturer in Computer Science\n\n\n\nI am an experienced Computer Science Lecturer with a PhD in IT and a Post Doctorate in blockchain networks. I design and deliver modern course content, lead modules, and provide mentorship to students. Some of my international projects includes industry-scale software, based on blockchain technology for supply chain traceability with University Technology Petronas, Malaysia and University of Southeastern Philippines, delivering enterprise-scale software, a patent, intellectual property, and authored peer-reviewed research. My earlier roles involved advancing machine learning applications and supporting student development through hands-on teaching and project supervision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNgozi Nneke\nComputer Science Lecturer\n\n\n\nI’m a passionate lecturer in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at UA92.

In my free time I play chess and watch videos on a variety of topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmar Alobaidi\nDigital Lecturer\n\n\n\nWith a Ph.D. in Computer Science (AI) from Manchester Metropolitan University, I bring over five years of experience in higher education. Most recently, I served as an IT Lecturer, teaching Python, Java, and database systems, and previously taught at Sussex University, where I developed programming modules and full course materials. My research interests include AI-driven learning technologies, and I have a strong background in programming and web development. Outside of work, I enjoy web design, reading, current affairs, and spending time with family and friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteph Riley\nSenior Lecturer in Digital\n\n\n\nI am a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science and a PhD researcher in Information Science, with particular interests in system analysis and design. My research focuses on data management and information retrieval, exploring how information can be organised, accessed, and utilised effectively in digital systems. Over the past 20 years, I have had the privilege of teaching both adult learners and undergraduate students, taking on a range of responsibilities including supervision, mentoring and curriculum design. Alongside my work in education, I am also a published author and have been involved in innovative approaches to teaching and learning. Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time reading and exploring nature through hiking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Excellence Framework Silver Award\nFIND OUT MORE\n\n\nA TEF Silver award is a recognition that a university or college provides high-quality teaching, learning, and outcomes for its students. It’s given by the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), a national scheme that assesses undergraduate courses in the UK. \n\n\n\n\nASK OUR DIGITAL STUDENTS\nOur friendly ambassadors are ready to answer your questions. Click on the ‘Ask me a question’ button to start a conversation.\n\n\n\n\n*The NSS results referred to above compares UA92’s results against the 4 Universities in Greater Manchester (University of Bolton, Manchester Metropolitan University, Salford University and The University of Manchester). Teaching, Assessment and Feedback and Academic support refers to the average score across all questions in these themes. Mental health support services refers to question: How well communicated was information about your university/college’s mental wellbeing support services?\n**There may be exams in some subject areas, but we avoid this where possible. Any exams will be undertaken at the end of the module instead of at the end of the academic year.\n*** If you start in February, April or June or as an accelerated student, we can’t guarantee your timetable will be fixed am/pm throughout your studies.\n\n\n\n\nENTRY REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n\nThe standard entry requirements for the BSc (Hons) Cyber Security degree course is 104 UCAS points.* However, each application is assessed on an individual basis, taking into consideration a wide range of factors.

Explore different assessment methods used to collect, analyse, and interpret information on the nutritional status of individuals and groups. This will help you identify specific dietary requirements, malnutrition, overconsumption, or optimal nutritional status, giving you the skills to recommend adaptations for health and/or performance gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 8 - Public Health and Policy \n\n\n\nInspire communities to lead healthy and active lifestyles.

Get ready to transform theory into real-world practice, drawing upon relevant models and frameworks to guide your planning and actions. You will learn how to consider and address the biology, psychology, and social factors that all play a role in the health of individuals and groups. By understanding these connections, you’ll learn how to support the promotion of sustainable healthy behaviours, and even help people change their habits for the better.\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 10 - Advanced Nutrition for Health, Exercise and Sport\n\n\n\nThis module will explore the powerful relationship between food and health! You’ll explore how diet can positively or negatively influence common health conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and more.

I am extremely passionate about grassroots sport and developing it where I can. I am a former Sport92 president who contributed to building Sport92 from its beginning. I am originally from Southport, where I worked in schools as an external sports coach and running Healthy Active Food (Government funded sports camp ) in over 20 different schools in Merseyside. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Excellence Framework Silver Award\nFIND OUT MORE\n\n\nA TEF Silver award is a recognition that a university or college provides high-quality teaching, learning, and outcomes for its students. It’s given by the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), a national scheme that assesses undergraduate courses in the UK. \n\n\n\n\nASK OUR SPORTS STUDENTS\nOur friendly ambassadors are ready to answer your questions.
